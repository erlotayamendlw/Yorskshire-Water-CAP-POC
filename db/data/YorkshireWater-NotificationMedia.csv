The plumber explains that this is a bad installation that causes frequent blockages [00:28, 01:50].  The plumber uses a drain snake to clear the blockage [04:38], but due to the misaligned pipe joint and lip, complete clearance is difficult and requires extensive repair [05:00].","Now I've already gone down and snaked this drain and we've got flow and we're gonna go in and take a look with a camera and see what is going on and why it clogged. Yeah, I'm glad you're doing this because uh these people have lived here for uh only a few years now and and they've had you come out how many times? Uh this is about the fifth time I'm coming out every six months. Uh it's a high frequency, you know, there's something going on and we're finally gonna go down and take a look and see what what's causing the backups. This is a uh pipe joint where two pipes come together and you have a root intrusion, very small. Uh this was definitely not the clog. Is that fuzzy stuff coming in there is roots coming but is it coming into the pipe or? Oh yeah. Yeah, they like the water and the nutrients in there and uh it's food for them. And that'll just continue to grow and and eventually it can it can it block a pipe? Oh yeah. Two minutes later... This here is a clean out access. Uh they have I haven't seen another one. It's buried in the front yard and uh it's under the dirt or a bush. What's this? This is um the flat surface of the lights of the camera shining on it. Uh it's a smaller pipe size and uh there's a oh it looks like a half inch to a one inch lip down at the bottom and you can see the water puddling on it. That looks like it could really stop something uh and cause big problems. Is that is that a problem or is that typical? No, this is not typical. This is really a bad installation here. You would never go from a larger pipe to a smaller pipe uh and have a lip like that it creates creates clogs actually. The camera is kind of you could see it jumping over the lip uh which means anything could catch on that bottom lip. So prob probably our clog was like right there before you cleaned it out with the snake, right? No, this looks like your main clog. Oh wow, it's still there. You you but you clogged I thought you cleaned it out. Well, we cabled through it and you could see off to the right hand side that the water is flowing around it but the clog is com completely there. So if you didn't have the camera we just you know we would have thought it was cleaned out, huh? Oh yeah. This is where most plumbers will What are you doing? I'm hitting it with the camera head trying like a battering ram to push it or see kind of what it is or if it will move. But it looks pretty tough. Uh it's probably something growing in from the side. Yeah cuz uh yeah this you had the water it was running pretty well it looked like it was clear. Yeah, that's the deceiving part of drain clearing is is if you if you really don't go looking down in the sewer uh the assumption is is it's working because you got flow and you can clearly see that I got flow but the obstruction was still there. Running a little more water to wash the camera head down and see if I can't kind of flush it down by me pushing on it with the camera. So this would be likely to clog again like pretty quick. Yeah. Those are more connections um more pipe joints. You could see how important it is that the pipes uh line up together and that they're not they're not off. You can see the little lip there. So how about is this pipe uh you know is is its typical or? No, this one's pretty bad. Uh you have a lot of small intrusions which might not clog but they will eventually you had a different pipe size and you had a large object growing in there. So this one's pretty bad. My recommendation would be is uh I could remove the things in the front yard from vegetation to cement uh put your front yard back together as if we were never there. This is uh your city sewer main. This is what's out in the middle of the street. So we're out about fifty three feet. All right, we're coming down now with the snake and I have the camera head right behind the head of the snake and oh there I go. I can't even get it through the little lip um uh we got lucky. And you can see how that really could snag a lot of stuff. Yep, now we're gonna basically uh without the camera being right here uh there's no way for any plumbing technician to find this exact location and really work this clog. Uh you really need you really need the the drain vision camera right at that spot so you can see what you're doing on on the screen. Yeah, in fact you would have probably come cleared it with the snake the first time and we thought we were pretty much done. We thought it was pretty much cleared out. But uh but I'm glad you're down here with this now cuz we can see that there's still more there. Yeah. Yeah well now that you have the camera down there you should be uh able to clear it out pretty easily I guess. This one's pretty tough. Let's see what happens. Another four minutes later... Okay so you've been working this clog now for like six minutes and uh it's still there. Is that pretty typical? Uh this one's a real tough one and uh you know we had an improper installation, we have root intrusions everywhere and this one was the worst. Um you know we can dig up your front yard, pull your plants out, remove concrete, put in a new pipe and put your front yard back together uh as if we were never there. And that would be my recommendation for this sewer line. So if you were to replace the sewer line uh what would you replace it with? Uh we do cast iron sewer main pipe. So it's one one long shot all the way down or? Well they come in ten foot uh sections so there would be a joint but there's a rubber coupling with a stainless steel band and the plants really can't grow through it because of the new technology. So as all the modern technology would be what you'd put in.

MN005,ID005,The CCTV drain inspection video reveals a severe blockage in the drainage system caused by substantial root intrusion and accumulated debris. This blockage has resulted in a complete obstruction of water flow. The impacts are significant: customer impacts include potential flooding and sewage backup; environmental impacts involve contamination risks from sewage overflow; and financial impacts arise from the cost of repair and potential property damage. The urgency is high due to the complete blockage and potential for immediate flooding. The GenAI categorisation is 'Blockage found (internal cause)' because the root intrusion is an internal factor within the drainage pipe itself. The severity is rated high.,"The primary cause of the blockage is the extensive intrusion of tree roots into the drainage pipe.

MN007,ID007,"This video compilation presents sewer line inspection footage from multiple properties, revealing various levels of deterioration and damage. The most severe issue is a completely compromised section of plastic sewer line at 38.5 feet in the Savage property (built 1987) with a massive hole in the side. Other significant problems include broken tile connections and water infiltration. In Saint Paul (homes built in 1948 and 1925), the inspections show broken tile connections and significant water infiltration, resulting in the almost complete detachment of a sewer pipe section in one instance. Age of the infrastructure seems to be a significant contributing factor. The Robbinsdale property (built in 1975) exhibited an interesting finding but no significant problems. Multiple instances show sewer rats. The overall severity is high, requiring urgent repairs due to the extensive structural damage, potential for water contamination, and the risk of sewer backups and flooding. The primary categorisation is Poor condition / known defect due to the age and visible damage of the pipes. Secondary categorisations include multiple instances of water infiltration and multiple related complaints (implied).","The primary cause of the sewer line issues appears to be age-related deterioration. The pipes shown in the video, especially the older tile and plastic ones, exhibit significant cracking, breakage, and holes. This is compounded by water infiltration, further weakening the structure of the pipes and contributing to collapses and leaks. The age of the homes (ranging from 1925 to 1998) aligns with the observed deterioration, indicating a need for proactive maintenance and replacement of aging sewer infrastructure.",Poor condition / known defect,9,90,"The video shows several sewer line inspections. A significant portion of a plastic sewer line is compromised [0:26] with a massive hole visible on the left side [0:34].  In another instance, a broken tile connection is observed [0:50] with outside water leaking in [0:57]. Further inspection reveals a major offset in the pipe [1:06].  A completely broken and detached sewer pipe is shown [1:12], and another shows a gap in the pipe preventing further camera access [1:39].

On the top of the pipe there still may be pipe there towards the top, but up in the upper corner that pipe is actually gone. Saint Paul, home built in 1948. You can see evidence of a broken tile connection here on the bottom left and left side of the pipe as well as the top right. At 59.8 feet, it looks like we have evidence of outside water leaking into this sewer pipe here. At 80.3 feet we're going to have to stop the sewer inspection as the uh camera will not be able to get by this lip. There's a major offset here in the bottom of the pipe connection. Saint Paul, home built in 1925. At 59.2 feet we do see a almost completely broken and detached sewer pipe. This is going to be roughly three to four feet back from the other collapsed section of line. We can see outside the sewer pipe. Robbinsdale, home built in 1975 (no problem, interesting find). We're uh seeing your line tie into a old brick manhole. Lakeville, built in 1995. So here's a great view of your uh pipe here at the defector. You can literally see a massive gap there at the bottom of that pipe. That's what's preventing us from getting through with their camera any further. Lakeville, built in 1998.

MN008,ID008,"This video shows a plumber investigating a sewer line that has been experiencing recurring backups. The customer is experiencing significant inconvenience and potential costs due to the repeated need for sewer line jetting and the ongoing issue. The environmental impact is limited to the potential for sewage overflow and contamination, although this is not directly observed in the video. The financial impact includes the cost of multiple jetting attempts and the plumber's current service call. The analysis reveals a blockage in the sewer line at multiple locations beyond the 80-foot mark, and also shows signs of a connection to another sewer line as well as a large sag in the main line. The cause of the issue appears to be multiple foreign objects, potentially air fresheners, which have become lodged within the line, combined with the existing sag in the pipe which may be holding additional water and debris. The initial jetting attempts were unsuccessful because the blockage was not properly addressed. The overall severity is moderate to high due to the repeat nature of the issue and the extent of the blockage identified via the camera feed. The incident is categorized as Repeat incidence due to the multiple jetting attempts and service calls. The primary cause analysis points to the combination of foreign object blockages and a pre-existing sag in the sewer line.","The main cause of the sewer line backup is a combination of factors: Multiple foreign objects, likely air fresheners, have become lodged in the sewer line beyond the 80-foot mark, significantly restricting flow. The presence of a sag in the line at approximately the 40-foot mark exacerbates the issue, potentially creating a low point where water and debris accumulate and further impede flow. The prior jetting attempts may not have adequately addressed the issue due to the presence of these foreign objects deep within the sewer line. The objects and sag work in tandem to restrict water movement and result in the backups reported.",Repeat incidence,7,80,"A plumber investigates a sewer line that has been experiencing recurring backups.  He uses a camera to inspect the line [01:28] and discovers a blockage at approximately 80 feet [06:04] consisting of several circular objects that look like lids or facial cleansing pads.
